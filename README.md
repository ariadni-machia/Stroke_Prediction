# Stroke_Prediction
 Predicting a stroke based on a .csv file containing patient information and information on the existence of a stroke or not. Also, the dataset is analyzed and graphically represented, detecting and managing missing values with the methods: Column Removal, Average, Linear Regression and k-Nearest Neighbors. For each of them, stroke is predicted  using Random Forest by splitting the dataset into a 75%-25% training-test ratio. For measuring the performance of the model, we are using the metrics: f1 score, precision and recall
