# Stroke_Prediction
 Predicting a stroke based on the healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv file containing patient information and information on the existence of a stroke or not. 
(A) The dataset is analyzed and graphically represented.
(B) Detecting and managing missing values with the methods: 
1. Column Removal
2. Average
3. Linear Regression
4. k-Nearest Neighbors
(C) For each of the above, stroke is predicted using Random Forest by splitting the dataset into a 75%-25% training-test ratio. For measuring the performance of the model, we are using the metrics: f1 score, precision and recall.
